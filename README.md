What is Aidly
Aidly allows to easily connect people and organizations that are in need with those who are willing to help. Thanks to our application organizations are able to quickly find volunteers available in their area and speed up the process of running their events. Active volunteers, on the other hand, can find and apply for activities that they really want to help out, be it simply walking the dog, taking care of someoneâ€™s granny or coordinating a larger event.
